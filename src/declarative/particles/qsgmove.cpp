    \brief The Move element allows you to set a new position, speed or acceleration on particles

    You'll often want to set the 'once' property to true for efficiency in the case where you just
    want to set the parameter. Otherwise, the parameter will be needlessly set to the same thing
    every simulation cycle.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty StochasticDirection QtQuick.Particles2::Move::position

    Affected particles will have their position set to this direction,
    relative to the ParticleSystem. When interpreting directions as points,
    imagine it as an arrow with the base at the 0,0 of the ParticleSystem and the
    tip at where the specified position will be.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty StochasticDirection QtQuick.Particles2::Move::speed

    Affected particles will have their speed set to this direction.

    Affected particles will have their acceleration set to this direction.
*/


/*!
    \qmlproperty bool QtQuick.Particles2::Move::relative

    Whether the affected particles have their existing position/speed/acceleration added
