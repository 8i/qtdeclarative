    \brief The Gravity element allows you to set a constant accleration in an angle

    This element will set the acceleration of all affected particles to a vector of
    the specified magnitude in the specified angle. If the angle or acceleration is
    not varying, it is more efficient to set the specified acceleration on the Emitter.

    This element models the gravity of a massive object whose center of
    gravity is far away (and thus the gravitational pull is effectively constant
    across the scene). To model the gravity of an object near or inside the scene,
    use PointAttractor.
